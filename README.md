# Amelia
  
  Amelia is a machine learning algorithm that focuses on detecting signs of physical abuse on women. Since domestic violence cases in the island has been getting more frequent everyday we wanted to develop a tool that could help those going through it.
  
  With Amelia we scan the womens face and verify if there's any signs of brusing which we could relate to physical abuse. This could be useful in platforms such as Facebook, which already detects faces to see if there's a noticable change on the persons face.
